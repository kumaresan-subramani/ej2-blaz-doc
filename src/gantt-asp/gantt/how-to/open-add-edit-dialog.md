# Open add/edit dialog dynamically

Gantt add and edit dialogs can be opened dynamically by using `openAddDialog` and `openEditDialog` methods. The following code example shows how to open add and dialog on separate button click actions.

{% aspTab template="gantt/editing/openEditAddDialog", sourceFiles="openEditAddDialog.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

>NOTE: We should select any one of the row in Gantt to open the edit dialog.
