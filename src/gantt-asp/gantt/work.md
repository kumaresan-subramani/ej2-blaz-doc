# Work

The work is the total hours required to complete a task. Work can be mapped from the data source field using the property [`taskFields.work`](../api/gantt/taskFields/#work). Work can be measured in
`Hour`, `Day`, `Minute`. By default, work is measured in `Hour` and it can be changed, by using the property [`workUnit`](../api/gantt/#viewtype).

>Note: When the work field is mapped from the data source, the default task type will be `FixedWork`.

{% aspTab template="gantt/work/work", sourceFiles="work.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Task type

The work, duration and resource unit fields of a task depends upon each other and will change automatically on editing any one of these fields. But we can also set these fieldâ€™s values as constant using the [`taskType`](../api/gantt/#tasktype) property. `FixedUnit` is the default [`taskType`](../api/gantt/#tasktype). The following values can be set to the [`taskType`](../api/gantt/#tasktype)
 property,

* `FixedDuration` - Duration task field will remain constant while updating resource unit or work field.
* `FixedWork` - Work field will remain constant while updating resource unit or duration fields.
* `FixedUnit` - Resource units will remain constant while updating duration or work field.

Task Type | Changes in Duration | Changes in work | Changes in Resource Units
-----|-----|-----|-----

Fixed Work | Resource unit updates. Note: For manually scheduled task work will update.| Duration field updates. Note: For manually scheduled task resource unit updates. |Duration will update. Note: For manually scheduled task work field updates.
Fixed Unit | Work field updates | Duration field updates. Note: For manually scheduled task resource unit updates.| Duration will update. Note: For manually scheduled task work field updates.
