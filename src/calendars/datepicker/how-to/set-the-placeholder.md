# Set the Placeholder

The following example demonstrates how to set `Placeholder` in the DatePicker component.

Using [Placeholder](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor~Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars.SfDatePicker%601~Placeholder.html), you can display a short hint in the input element.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars

<SfDatePicker TValue="DateTime?" Placeholder="Select a date"></SfDatePicker>
```

The output will be as follows.
