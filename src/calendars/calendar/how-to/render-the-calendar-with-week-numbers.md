# Render the Calendar with WeekNumber

You can enable `WeekNumber` in the Calendar by using the [WeekNumber](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor~Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars.CalendarBase%601~WeekNumber.html) property.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars

<SfCalendar TValue="DateTime?" WeekNumber=true></SfCalendar>
