# Globalization

## Localization

The [`Localization`](../../common/localization/) library allows you to localize default text content of the Grid. The grid component has static text on some features (like group drop area text, pager information text, etc.) that can be changed to other cultures (Arabic, Deutsch, French, etc.) by defining the
[`locale`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid~Locale.html) value and translation object.

The following list of properties and its values are used in the grid.

Locale keywords |Text
-----|-----
EmptyRecord |No records to display.
True |true
False |false
InvalidFilterMessage |Invalid filter data.
GroupDropArea |Drag a column header here to group its column.
UnGroup |Click here to ungroup.
GroupDisable |Grouping is disabled for this column.
FilterbarTitle |\s filter bar cell.
EmptyDataSourceError |DataSource must not be empty at initial load as columns are generated from the dataSource in AutoGenerate Column Grid.

### Loading translations

To load translation object in an application, use **load** function of the **L10n** class.

The following example demonstrates the Grid in **Deutsch** culture.

{% aspTab template="grid/globalization/localization", sourceFiles="localization.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Internationalization

The [`Internationalization`](../../common/internationalization/) library is used to globalize number, date, and time values in grid component using format strings in the **Format**.

{% aspTab template="grid/globalization/internationalization", sourceFiles="internationalization.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

> * In the above sample, **Freight** column is formatted by **NumberFormatOptions**.
> * By default, **locale** value is **en-US**. If you want to change the **en-US** culture to a different culture, you have to change the [`locale`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid~Locale.html) accordingly.

## Right to left (RTL)

RTL provides an option to switch the text direction and layout of the Grid component from right to left. It improves the user experiences and accessibility for users who use right-to-left languages (Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, etc.). To enable RTL Grid, set the [`enableRtl`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid~EnableRtl.html) to true.

{% aspTab template="grid/globalization/righttoleft", sourceFiles="righttoleft.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
