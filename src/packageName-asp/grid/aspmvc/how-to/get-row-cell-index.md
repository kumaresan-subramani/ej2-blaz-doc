# Get specific row and cell index in Grid

You can get the specific row and cell index of the grid by using [`RowSelected`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid~RowSelected.html) event of the grid. Here, we can get the row and cell index by using **aria-rowindex**(get row Index from **tr** element) and **aria-colindex**(column index from **td** element) attribute.
