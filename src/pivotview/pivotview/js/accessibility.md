ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the pivot table:

* grid (role)
* row (role)
* gridcell (role)
* aria-selected (attribute)
* aria-expanded (attribute)
* aria-sort (attribute)
* aria-busy (attribute)
* aria-invalid (attribute)
* aria-grabbed (attribute)
* aria-owns (attribute)
* aria-label (attribute)
