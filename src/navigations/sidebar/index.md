# Overview

The **Sidebar** is an expandable and collapsible component that typically acts as a side container to place primary or secondary content alongside the main content.

There is a flexible option to show and hide Sidebar as per user interactions. Any type of HTML content and component can be placed in the Sidebar for quick access and for easy navigation like quick references, menu, list, and tree view.

## Key features

1. **Context**: The Sidebar can be initialized in any HTML element other than the body element.

2. **Types and positions**: Supports `Push`, `Over`, `Slide`, and `Auto` to expand or collapse the sidebar, and also allows to position it in the `Left` or `Right` direction.

3. **Auto close**: Allows to set the Sidebar in an expanded or collapsed state only in certain resolutions.

4. **Dock**: By default, supports display of short notifications about the content on docked mode.
