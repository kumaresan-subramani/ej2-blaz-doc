# Overview

The **TreeView** component is used to represent hierarchical data in a tree like structure with advanced functions to edit, drag and drop, select with CheckBox and more. TreeView can be populated from a data source such as an array of JavaScript objects or from DataManager.

## Key Features

* **Data Binding**: Binds the TreeView component with an array of JavaScript objects or `DataManager`.
* **CheckBox**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView without affecting the UI appearance.
* **Drag and Drop**: Allows you to drag and drop any node in TreeView.
* **Multi Selection**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView.
* **Node Editing**: Allows you to change the text of a node in TreeView.
* **Sorting**: Allows display of the TreeView nodes in an `ascending` or a `descending` order.
* **Accessibility**: Provides built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the TreeView component features through the keyboard, on-screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.
