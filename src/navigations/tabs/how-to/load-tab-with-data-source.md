# Load tab with DataSource

You can bind any data object to Tab items, by mapping it to a [header](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/aspnetcore/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.Navigations.TabHeader.html) and [content](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/aspnetcore/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.Navigations.TabTabItem~Content.html)&nbsp; property.

In the below demo, Data is fetched from an `OData` service using `DataManager`. The result data is formatted as a JSON object with `header` and `content` fields, which is set to items property of Tab.
