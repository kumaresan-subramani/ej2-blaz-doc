| AllowedTypes | Specifies the extensions of the image types allowed to insert on bowering and passing the extensions with comma separators. For example, pass allowedTypes as .jpg and .png.|
| Display | Sets the default display for an image when it is inserted in to the Rich Text Editor. Possible options are: `inline` and `break`.|
| Width | Sets the default width of the image when it is inserted in the Rich Text Editor.|
| Height | Sets the default height of the image when it is inserted in the Rich Text Editor.|
| SaveUrl | Provides URL to map the action result method to save the image.|

## Upload options

Through the `browse` option in the Image dialog, select the image from the local machine and insert into the Rich Text Editor content.

If the path field is not specified in the `RichTextEditorImageSettings`, the image will be converted into base 64 and blob url for the image will be created and the generated url will be set as src property of `<img>` tag as below.

The image has been loaded from the local machine and it will be saved in the given location.

```bash

<img src="blob:http://blazor.syncfusion.com/3ab56a6e-ec0d-490f-85a5-f0aeb0ad8879" >

```

> If you want to insert a lot of tiny images in the editor and don't want a specific physical location for saving images, you can opt to save format as Base64.

## Server side action

The selected image can be uploaded to the required destination by using the following controller action. Map this method name in `SaveUrl` property of `RichTextEditorImageSettings` and provide required destination path through `Path` property.

> The following code block shows saving the image file uploaded to Rich Text Editor using the `Blazor(ASP.NET Core Hosted)` project.

`Index.razor`

```csharp

<SfRichTextEditor>
    <RichTextEditorImageSettings SaveUrl="/api/SampleData/SaveFile" Path="../Images/"></RichTextEditorImageSettings>
    <p>Rich Text Editor allows to insert images from online source as well as local computer where you want to insert the image in your content.</p>
    <p><b>Get started Quick Toolbar to click on the image</b></p>
    <p>It is possible to add custom style on the selected image inside the Rich Text Editor through quick toolbar.</p>
    <img alt='Logo' style='width: 300px; height: 300px; transform: rotate(0deg);' src='https://blazor.syncfusion.com/demos/images/RichTextEditor/RTEImage-Feather.png' />
</SfRichTextEditor>

```

`HomeController.cs`

```csharp

[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private IWebHostEnvironment hostingEnv;
    public HomeController(IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        hostingEnv = env;
    }
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }

    [HttpPost("[action]")]
    public IActionResult SaveFile(IList<IFormFile> UploadFiles)
    {
        try
        {
            foreach (IFormFile file in UploadFiles)
            {
                if (UploadFiles != null)
                {
                    string filename = ContentDispositionHeaderValue.Parse(file.ContentDisposition).FileName.Trim('"');
                    if(!System.IO.Directory.Exists("Images"))
                    {
                        System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory("Images");
                    }
                    //To save the image in the sever side
                    filename = hostingEnv.ContentRootPath + "\\Images" + $@"\{filename}";
                    if (!System.IO.File.Exists(filename))
                    {
                        using (FileStream fs = System.IO.File.Create(filename))
                        {
                            file.CopyTo(fs);
                            fs.Flush();
                        }
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        Response.Clear();
                        Response.StatusCode = 204;
                        Response.HttpContext.Features.Get<IHttpResponseFeature>().ReasonPhrase = "File already exists.";
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Response.Clear();
            Response.ContentType = "application/json; charset=utf-8";
            Response.StatusCode = 204;
            Response.HttpContext.Features.Get<IHttpResponseFeature>().ReasonPhrase = "No Content";
            Response.HttpContext.Features.Get<IHttpResponseFeature>().ReasonPhrase = e.Message;
        }
        return Content("");
    }
