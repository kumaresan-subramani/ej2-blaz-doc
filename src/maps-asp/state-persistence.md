# State Persistence

## State Persistence

State persistence allows the Maps to retain the current modal value in the browser cookies for state maintenance. This action is handled through the `enablePersistence` property which is set to false by default. When it is set to true, some of the Maps component model values will be retained even after refreshing the page.
