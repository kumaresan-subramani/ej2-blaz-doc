**Globalization**

Globalization is the process of designing and developing a component that works in different cultures/locales. Internationalization library is used to globalize number, date, and time values in the tree map control using the [`format`] property in the treemap model.

**Numeric format**

In the following code example, tooltip is globalized to Deutsch culture.

{% aspTab template="treemap/internationlization/internationlization", sourceFiles="internationlization.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
